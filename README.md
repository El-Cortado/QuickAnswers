# QuickAnswers
A quick open questions-answers style app that works with notifications for small surveys.

The user can construct quick questions and choose an input method, such as "What is the cutest animal?" with input method *short text*, and the question will be sent to around 10 random people using the app who are now online. They will receive a notification with the question and their answers will be sent back anonymously to the survey's creator.

Essentially the user interacts with the app in 3 ways:
* Answering a question the app delivered to him from someone else
* Constructing a small survey to send to people
* Receiving answers on your survey
